1.a. A file is a named collection of information or data that is stored on a computer. It can be a text file, image file, audio file, or any other type of file.

b. To read from a file in Python, you can use the following syntax:
file = open('filename.txt', 'r')
data = file.read()
print(data)
file.close()

c. The modes of operation in opening a file are:

'r': Read mode. This allows you to read the contents of the file.
'w': Write mode. This allows you to write new contents to the file. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten.
'a': Append mode. This allows you to add new contents to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, it will be created.
'x': Exclusive creation mode. This allows you to create a new file, but it will raise an error if the file already exists.
't': Text mode. This is the default mode and is used for reading or writing text files.
'b': Binary mode. This is used for reading or writing binary files, such as images or audio files.

2.a. Here is a Python console application that calculates the average score of three students in OLAG:
def calculate_average_score():
    scores = []
    for i in range(3):
        score = float(input("Enter the score of student {}: ".format(i+1)))
        scores.append(score)

    average_score = sum(scores) / len(scores)
    print("The average score of the three students is:", average_score)

calculate_average_score()

b. To find the population in Country B given the information provided, you can use the following Python console application:
population_c = 420
population_a = population_c / 0.5
population_b = population_a / 0.6

print("The population in Country B is:", population_b)
